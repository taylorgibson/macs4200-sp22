The way it will do this is by using a `for` loop to select each valid multiplicative key `km` and for each of those keys use another `for` loop to select each valid additive key `ka`. After computing the score for each of the 312 candidate plaintexts, the code stores each `km`, `ka`, and $\\chi^2$ score into a list together. Each of these lists is then stored into a different list named `results` that contains all possible 312 lists.

Assuming everything before this cell worked correctly, you should just be able to run the cell below to generate the results.\n",
